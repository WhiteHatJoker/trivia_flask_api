# Full Stack API Project

## Trivia App

Trivia is a webpage app that can help you play your favorite trivia game with your friends in front of your PC. The webpage lets you add interesting trivia questions and answers to make your game experience even more involving. All the questions get stored in the database so you won't lose them. You can browse all the questions or by the given category, the website also allows you to search for a specific question. The most important thing is that the app lets you play the quiz taking care of giving out random and unique questions, also taking care of counting points.

The project is built using Flask as an API on the backend and using React on the frontend. Look below for instructions on how to run it on your PC.

## Instructions

There are `TODO` comments throughout project to guide you. 
Instructions:

1. Clone the repository
2. Look into the frontend READMe file for a guide on running the backend part of an app [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)
3. Look into the frontend READMe file for a guide on running the frontend part of an app [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)

We recommend following the instructions in those files in order.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will need to update the endpoints after you define them in the backend. Those areas are marked with TODO and can be searched for expediency.
